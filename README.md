Project Summary
EA Kazi https://eakazi.africa/ 
(East Africa EdTech and Job Platform with focus on Digital Technology)
 
E.A. Kazi is a platform built on the NEAR Blockchain protocol that intends to facilitate maximizing the opportunity in creating jobs and diverse income streams for the people, trainers and trainees inclusive. E.A Kazi provides a single platform for experts to provide training, and trainees to learn new skills, get jobs and get paid within and outside of the country.
In summary, E.A Kazi is a platform that combines EdTech with focus on 4IR tech knowledge acquisition with opportunities creating an incentive for all parties to learn, teach and earn.  
E.A Kazi as a solution
E.A Kazi will be the African version of freelancer.com and fiverr.com only better as it will be working on blockchain technology transparency and smart contract automation. It will also have smart contract enabled blockchain payment integrated into its payment option enabling payments easily with local currencies as an option. The solution will empower and enrich all trainees with royalty rewards on each secured contract by the certified trainees. With this system, the training is provided for free in exchange for a lifetime cumulative benefit.
Participants.
1.  	The Trainee/Freelancer: Every freelancer will start from first being a trainee on the platform. They will need to acquire blockchain issued certifications on various or specific industries of choice after being trained by experts and completing a few courses. As a promoted Freelancer, they will be able to bid on various jobs and also still further their training in other fields if wished.
 
2.  	The Trainers: Trainers are carefully selected experts in various fields upon application and certificate validation on the platform. They provide free training to the Freelancers/Trainees in respective fields and award certificates, powered by the platform. Each trainer is then plugged into the system to get a 2.5% reward on every successfully completed contract in line with the respective trained field by every trained and certified Freelancer.

More details on technical implementation:
NFT Function explained:
As a certificate:
Trainer completes the training process for the trainee.
He computes the attributes of the token to contain the course and grades. 
He created the NFT.
He issues it to the address of the trainee and pays the platform fee. 
Features of the NFT.
They are non-tradable which means cant be sold.
The have different properties (Attached to each area such as Blockchain, AI, ML as solution oriented or Java, Python etc as language oriented properties)
They are non-exchangeable which means it can’t be sent from one wallet to another either, they can only be issued into a wallet. 
B. As a job acceptance criteria.

Just as voting on the blockchain can be limited to an asset balance in accounts, job bidding can also be limited to NFT balance in users addresses. 
Example: A recruiter is looking for a blockchain programmer with proficiency in Solidity. This creates two criteria (NFT properties). The NFT properties in each balance of the trainees are then queried in order to make them eligible to bid on the project. 
Bidding is done simply by providing two answers or factors which can’t be modified. Project cost and ETA measured by hours to delivery. 
Bidding is then approved by the project owner and the smart contract kicks in.

C. As a Trainer remuneration base.

Each time an issued NFT is applied in bidding on a project, a royalty smart contract is invoked to process 2.5% deduction payable into the issuers’ account, in this case, the trainer. .
