E.A Kazi as a solution
E.A Kazi will be the African version of freelancer.com and fiverr.com only better as it will be working on blockchain technology transparency and smart contract automation. It will also have smart contract enabled blockchain payment integrated into its payment option enabling payments easily with local currencies as an option. The solution will empower and enrich all trainees with royalty rewards on each secured contract by the certified trainees. With this system, the training is provided for free in exchange for a lifetime cumulative benefit.
Participants.
1.  	The Trainee/Freelancer: Every freelancer will start from first being a trainee on the platform. They will need to acquire blockchain issued certifications on various or specific industries of choice after being trained by experts and completing a few courses. As a promoted Freelancer, they will be able to bid on various jobs and also still further their training in other fields if wished.
 
2.  	The Trainers: Trainers are carefully selected experts in various fields upon application and certificate validation on the platform. They provide free training to the Freelancers/Trainees in respective fields and award certificates, powered by the platform. Each trainer is then plugged into the system to get a 2.5% reward on every successfully completed contract in line with the respective trained field by every trained and certified Freelancer.
